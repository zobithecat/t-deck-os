/* snt_piperlite_q8.h -- int8 inference of the piperlite decoder.
 *
 * Quantization scheme (blobs from tools/export_piperlite_q8.py):
 *   - weights: symmetric per-output-channel int8 (max|row|/127), biases fp32
 *     -- the int8 payload is the distribution blob
 *   - activations: int16 lane holding 12-bit values (sat +/-2047), symmetric
 *     per-tensor STATIC scales calibrated offline over real eval128 latents
 *     (one scale per named tensor: z, pre, per stage act/up/branch-t1/y1/t2/
 *     mix, post-conv input "ap"). Pure int8 activations were measured first
 *     and top out at ~0.985 audio corr (heavy-tailed tensors, error spread
 *     across all stages); 12 bits keeps every int32 accumulator safe.
 *   - convolutions accumulate int16 x int8 -> int32, then requantize with an
 *     fp32 multiplier (s_in * s_w[oc] / s_out); residual adds happen at the
 *     requant point in the shared output scale; the residual-bank mean (/3)
 *     is folded into the bank-output requant
 *   - the final post conv requantizes straight to fp32 (pre_tanh is never
 *     quantized -- the 0.01-slope/tanh sensitivity), tanh + the optional
 *     post filter run in fp32 with weights dequantized on the fly.
 *
 * meta_q8.bin carries dims, the activation-scale table, per-tensor kind /
 * offset / size and per-channel weight-scale offsets, so this code hardcodes
 * no shapes. weights_q8.bin is pure int8 payload (the distribution blob).
